<?php
/**
 * XML Tag Object (php5)
 * 
 * This object stores all of the direct children of itself in the $children array. They are also stored by
 * type as arrays. So, if, for example, this tag had 2 <font> tags as children, there would be a class member
 * called $font created as an array. $font[0] would be the first font tag, and $font[1] would be the second.
 * 
 * To loop through all of the direct children of this object, the $children member should be used.
 *
 * To loop through all of the direct children of a specific tag for this object, it is probably easier 
 * to use the arrays of the specific tag names, as explained above.
